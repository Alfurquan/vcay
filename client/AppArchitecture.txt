Authentication and Authorization Flow ---->

1)Send username and password to Login
2)Server validates username and password and sets a httponly cookie to hold the JWT
3)The client (React and Redux) maintains a state in the redux store to keep track of The
logged in user. The client gets this info once the user gets logged in.
4)client store the role,name,id of the user in the redux state
5)client sends the token in the cookie to access protected routes.
6)Once the JWT expires the server sends a 500 error indicating that the JWT is not valid
7)This error is catched by the client and it redirects the user to login page and logs the user out
